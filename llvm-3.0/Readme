This file describes the installation and usage of the llvm bindings.
	

Initial setup:
==============
	
svn co http://svn.dsource.org/projects/bindings/trunk/llvm-3.0
cd llvm-3.0


Building your application:
==========================

LLVM c interface doesn't expose all required functionality, that's 
why some extra bindings have been implemented as a "c++ to c to d" 
bridge (c++ to c is Target.cpp and Ext.cpp, c to d is Target.d and Ext.d).
	
make

This command will compile object files llvmExt.o 
and llvmTarget.o which should be linked with your D code. 
It will also compile and link sample program main.d.

Execute resulting application to check whether everything has been built 
successfully. It creates an emply LLVM module and dumps it to console.


Known issues:
=============

1. On some systems, incluning Ubuntu 11.10, linking may fail with message 
that libLLVMSupport.a in function PrintStackTrace(void*) has undefined 
reference to dladdr. 

Workaround is to compile LLVM with cmake specifying the following variable:

-DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-ldl

2. dmd2 is assumed to be the name of DMD compiler. If it is not the case,
please update Makefile accordingly.
