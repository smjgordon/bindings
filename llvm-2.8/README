This file describes the installation and usage of the llvm bindings.

Initial setup:
==============

svn co http://svn.dsource.org/projects/bindings/trunk/llvm-2.8
cd llvm-2.8
./prebuild.sh

prebuild.sh builds Target.o and Ext.o which have to be passed
to the linker. For convenience, these *.o files are also merged
into a single library libllvm-c-ext.a.

Target.o and Ext.o are usually not needed for the regular
llvm c interface. But the D bindings add some extra bindings,
because the official c interface just doesn't expose all
functionality from the c++ interface. These are implemented as a
"c++ to c to d" bridge (c++ to c is Target.cpp and Ext.cpp, c to
d is Target.d and Ext.d).

Building your application:
==========================

To compile and link a file main.d, run

LLVMD=/path/to/llvm-dbindings
LLVM_LIBS=`llvm-config --libs | sed 's/-l/-L-l/g'`
ldc -I=$LLVMD \
	$LLVM_LIBS \
	-L=$LLVMD/libllvm-c-ext.a \
	-L-ldl -L-lstdc++ -relocation-model=pic \
	main.d

Parameters:
LLVM_LIBS                 a list of all llvm libraries, formatted for ldc
-L=$LLVMD/libllvm-c-ext.a only needed when you use Target.d or Ext.d
-L-lstdc++                links in the c++ standard library (llvm at it's core is c++)
-relocation-model=pic     necessary for calling code in your app from inside of the llvm vm
